# The 5.23 Lens (`lens-523/`)

The same air-hockey Lens as [`lens/`](LENS.md), carried forward to **Lens Studio
5.23** and the current SPECS platform. `lens/` stays exactly where it is — it is
the version proven on Spectacles (2024), and nothing here changes it.

Two folders instead of one because a Lens Studio project can only move forward:
once 5.23 upgrades a project it will not open in 5.15 again. Keeping the 5.15
project untouched is what lets the Spectacles (2024) build stay playable while
the newer one moves.

| | `lens/` | `lens-523/` |
|---|---|---|
| Lens Studio | 5.15.4 | 5.23.0 |
| Target | Spectacles (2024) | current SPECS |
| Detector | `best.onnx` | `best.onnx` + `vector_yolo_qnn.dlc` |
| Hardware-tested | yes | yes |

Everything else — the server, the protocol, the wizard, the gameplay — is
shared, so one server plays with either. The 5.23 Lens dials the same
`ws://vectar.local:8777`, with one caveat that costs a first-run debugging
session if you do not know it: newer Specs do not resolve `.local`, so it also
needs a plain address (see below).

## What the migration actually changed

The Lens code needed **no API migration**. A scan for every deprecated
Spectacles (2024) API — `RemoteServiceModule`, the `loadAs*` remote-media
calls, `StereoCameraModule`, the depth-texture providers, `VoiceMLModule`,
`LeaderboardModule`, SyncKit's old `StorageProperty` generics — came back
empty. This Lens was already on `InternetModule` and the unified
`CameraModule`, which is what SPECS 27 wants.

What did change, all of it done by Lens Studio during the upgrade:

- **Packages moved to 2.0.0** — SpectaclesInteractionKit (0.17.2 → 2.0.0, SIK
  runtime 0.18.0), SpectaclesUIKit (0.1.5 → 2.0.0), SurfacePlacement (0.5.0 →
  2.0.0), Spectacles3DHandHints (1.2.0 → 2.0.0); SnapDecorators, Utilities and
  RemoteServiceGateway came across as 2.0.0 with the project upgrade. Our
  imports (`Interactable`, `SIK`, `WorldCameraFinderProvider`, `OneEuroFilter`,
  `NativeLogger`, `Event`) survived the major-version bump unchanged.
- **Shaders converted** — all eleven `.ss_graph` graphs became `.graphShader`,
  the 5.23 format. One-for-one, done by the editor.
- **Packages are archives now**, not unpacked folders, so the project tree is
  much smaller than the 5.15 one for the same content.

## The quantised detector

`Assets/ML/vector_yolo_qnn.dlc` is the same YOLO detector as `best.onnx`,
a quantised export. Both exports have identical shapes —
512×512×3 in, three heads of 64/32/16 × 18 out — so `CoffeeDetector` decodes
either one without knowing which it got.

Their **input normalisation must match too**, and that is easy to miss: the
importer defaults a fresh model to `scale = 1.0`, while this detector was
trained on pixels scaled to 0..1, which is what `best.onnx` carries
(`scale = 0.0039`, i.e. 1/255). A model fed 0..255 does not fail loudly — it
just detects nothing, or detects nonsense. Both assets now carry 0.0039 on all
three channels; if you ever re-import the `.dlc`, check that field first.

Both are shipped, but — measured on hardware — **the float export is what
actually runs, in both places**. The `.dlc` was meant for the glasses, and on
the glasses `MLComponent` hands it to the editor, which refuses it (see
"What newer Specs do differently"). Reaching the hardware needs the route, which
this Lens does not carry.

`CoffeeMLController` still picks between them — on-device it prefers
`modelQuantized` when one is wired, and falls back to `model` when it fails to
load, which is what happens today. Wiring is already done in the shipped scene
(GameController → `mlModel` = `best`, `mlModelQuantized` = `vector_yolo_qnn`).
Unwire `mlModelQuantized` to skip the failed attempt entirely; unwire both and
the game still plays on odometry alone.

## What newer Specs do differently

Three things behave differently from Spectacles (2024), all found on the first
device run and all now handled in code. Worth knowing, because each one fails
in a way that does not name itself.

**There is no left colour camera.** Asking for `Left_Color` throws out of
`onStart`, which kills the vision controller before anything else runs — the
Lens looks like it crashed for no reason. It now tries candidates in order and
keeps the first the device grants; on this hardware that is `Right_Color`, the
same one the Phone Defense project uses. A grayscale fallback is announced in
the log, since the detector was trained on colour.

**`.local` names do not resolve.** The Lens dials `ws://vectar.local:8777`,
which worked on Spectacles (2024) and works in the editor preview — on newer
Specs it silently never connects, and the Lens sits in `CONNECT_WS` with
nothing in the log to explain it. Paste the address the server console shows
under **Lens WS_URL** into `GameConfig.WS_URL_FALLBACK`; the Lens alternates
between the name and that address and keeps whichever opens. Leave it empty if
your headset resolves the name.

**The quantised model does not load through MLComponent.** On device it lands
on the editor, which refuses it:
`the load is refused`. The
`.dlc` needs the route to reach the hardware, which this Lens does not carry — so
vision runs on the float ONNX, exactly as it does in the preview. The `.dlc`
ships anyway: it is the same detector, and the moment a route exists it
is one input away. This is the device-gated question ADR #104 left open, and
the answer is no.

## Honest status

**Run on SPECS hardware, and it plays.** The Lens boots on the glasses,
calibrates the surface, connects to the server and drives the robot. Getting
there took three device-only fixes, listed above — none of them reachable in
the editor, where the camera, the name resolution and the model all behave
differently.

What is confirmed: the migration itself (packages, shaders, scene), the
protocol, hand calibration, and the game loop against a real robot. What is
not: the quantised model on device — it does not load through MLComponent, so
vision uses the float export on device too, and the `.dlc` remains unproven
hardware-side.

## Setup

Same as [docs/LENS.md](LENS.md), with two differences: open
`lens-523/robo-hockey-523.esproj` in **Lens Studio 5.23**, and set the Preview
panel device to **SPECS 27**. Experimental APIs still need enabling — the Lens
speaks plain `ws://`, which keeps it a dev lens rather than a store one. The
voice agent and its Remote Service Gateway token work exactly as described
there.
